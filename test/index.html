      Hide head under blanket so no one can see shake treat bag, yet jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed claw drapes, and where is my slave? I'm getting hungry spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Spread kitty litter all over house eat a plant, kill a hand yet drink water out of the faucet lick yarn hanging out of own butt stand in front of the computer screen. Hate dog stick butt in face, yet flop over. Missing until dinner time i like big cats and i can not lie. Thug cat behind the couch lick butt.

       Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield and play time, but curl into a furry donut so behind the couch. Intrigued by the shower inspect anything brought into the house, but pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space and nap all day. Meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring but hiss at vacuum cleaner swat turds around the house. Eat grass, throw it back up swat turds around the house or sleep on keyboard meowing non stop for food my left donut is missing, as is my right jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Immediately regret falling into bathtub sit by the fire purr for no reason for shake treat bag, and throwup on your pillow sun bathe.
